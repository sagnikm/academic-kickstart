I am a post-doctoral fellow at KTH Royal Institute of Technology since January 2019. My host is Danupon Nanongkai. In my previous avatar, I was a post-doctoral fellow at IUUK, Charles University, hosted by Michal Kouck√Ω until December 2018, in the APC group at KTH Royal Institute of Technology until August 2018, and a graduate student in theoretical computer science at TIFR Mumbai until August 2017, working under the guidance of Dr. Arkadev Chattopadhyay.

I was a recipient of TCS PhD Fellowship and my PhD research work was supported by this fellowship.
